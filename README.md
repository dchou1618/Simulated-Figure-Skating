Emergent Behavior and Changes in Satisfaction of Skaters on an Ice Rink
## Description
Constructed Netlogo Model of skater agents to identify interactions between individual skaters while on an ice rink. 
## Findings 
Model provides insights into how, contingent to the parameters of my model, the optimal satisfaction before everyone is worse off is at 12 skaters with a 31% fall rate. 
## Future Direction
Model could be significantly improved upon by considering variables such as skaters leaving or entering the rink depending on how many times they fall.
